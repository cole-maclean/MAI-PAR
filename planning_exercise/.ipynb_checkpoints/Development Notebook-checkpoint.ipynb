    "A discrete state planning exercise is presented to utilize and test the linear planning with a stack of goals ([PRISM](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/planning/readings/strips.pdf)) algorithm for agent planning.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A mobile robotic agent capable of making and serving coffee to offices within a 2D office building is tasked with efficiently serving the requested coffee petitions in the least amount of steps to reduce office worker disturbances. The office building is modelled as a 6x6 square grid of 36 offices, and the steps between 2 offices is defined as their manhattan distance. The agent is fed information about coffee machine and petition capacities and office locations, and is required to build a daily service plan to efficiently fulfill the petitions given the new office configuration.\n",

Through many different office configurations, the implemented agent performs logically and efficiently in collecting and serving petitions. In the simple case of diagaonal petitions an machines, the robot acts as expected by traversing directly diagonly along the service route, resulting in 10 steps. Similarily, with the simple diaganol petitions but in different machine capacity orders, the robot performs logically by serving the office with the machine of capacity the same as it's initial office, resulting in a total of 18 steps. The plan also performs effectively are more complicated office configurations."

Although the search hueristics help to discover more efficient plans, there does exist situations where the agent will perform sub-optimally. These cases arise when a coffee machine that can serve a petition is closer to that petiton, to another capable machine closer to the agent, causing the agent to unnecessarily backtrack to a less optimal machine. An example configuration of this is presented here.\n",
